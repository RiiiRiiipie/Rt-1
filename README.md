Statistical Modeling & Risk Analysis
Beyond high-dimensional regression, we explored alternative probability distributions to model financial returns effectively. The focus was on understanding the statistical properties of weekly Nifty 50 and sectoral index returns and evaluating the goodness-of-fit of different distributions.

Alternative Distributions Explored
To model the return distributions accurately, we investigated:

Laplace Distribution: Captures heavy tails and sharp peaks, making it a suitable alternative to the Normal distribution for financial returns.
Variance-Gamma Distribution: A flexible model incorporating skewness and excess kurtosis, often used for financial time series modeling.
Kumaraswamy-Laplace Distribution: A hybrid model that leverages the advantages of both Kumaraswamy and Laplace distributions to improve tail fitting.
Goodness-of-Fit Analysis
We assessed the suitability of these distributions for financial data using:

Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test: Measures the maximum deviation between the empirical and theoretical cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).
Anderson-Darling Test: A goodness-of-fit test that gives more weight to tail discrepancies.
Visual Inspection: Distribution fitting plots and probability density comparisons.
Sector-Wise Value at Risk (VaR) & Exceedance Probability
For risk management applications, we estimated Value at Risk (VaR) for different sectoral indices, providing insights into potential losses in extreme scenarios. Additionally, Exceedance Probability Predictions were performed to evaluate the likelihood of extreme negative returns across different sectors.

This analysis offers a statistical framework for risk assessment in financial markets, helping quantify uncertainties and enhance portfolio management strategies.
